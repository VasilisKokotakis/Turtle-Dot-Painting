# 🎨 Turtle Dot Painting

Bring Damien Hirst vibes to your Python screen with a splash of colors 🐢✨

This project uses the Python **turtle graphics** library to draw a grid of colorful dots — inspired by the famous dot paintings. Each run generates a new random palette arrangement, making it always unique.

---

## 🌟 Features

* Generates a **10 × 10 grid** of vibrant dots
* Colors are picked randomly from a curated palette 🎨
* Super fast drawing (no more waiting forever for turtle to finish 🐇💨)
* Starts painting from the bottom-left corner, just like an artist at their canvas

## 🖼️ Demo

When you run it, you’ll see something like this (but different every time!):

```
🔵 🔴 🟡 🟢 🟣
🟡 🟢 🔴 🔵 🟣
...
```

*(ok, not exactly like that, but way prettier 😎)*

## 🛠️ Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* `turtle` (built into Python 🐢)
* `random` (standard library)

No external libraries needed. Just pure Python magic ✨

---

## 💡 Ideas to Play With

* Change the number of dots (`number_of_dots`)
* Try different dot sizes (`tim.dot(20, ...)`)
* Add more colors to the palette
* Randomize dot sizes for a funky effect

## 🐢 Fun Fact

The **turtle** module was named after the original **Logo Turtle Robot** (from the 1960s). It was a real robot on wheels that drew with a pen! 🖊️
